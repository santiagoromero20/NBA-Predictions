# NBA-Predictions
Making Predictions of the NBA.
This is a continuation of the "NBA-Data-Analysis" project. By now, I have already collected and "tidy up" all the data I was going to use.
The first part of the project consists on predicting the Salaries of the NBA players of the 2021-2022 season. I did this with several models,
starting with a basic BaseLineModel programmed by myself, then a Linear Regression (with one varaible and multivariable) and finally a Decission
Tree Regressor. The second part of the project consists on predicting a playerÂ´s probability of getting into the NBA All Star Team.
For this task I appeal to Classification Models such as Logistic Regression or Decission Trees Classifiers.
